#Which is the most common tree species in crown layer 1? 
#answer: the most common tree species in the crown layer 1 is speacies 1

#How many trees of this species
#can be found in the whole data set?
#Answer: there are 91 of these trees in the whole data set.


#d) Which tree species' relative portion in second crown layer 
#is the highest (amount in 2.layer/amount in layer 1 and 2)? 
#divide the total in layer 2 by the sum of the total in layer 1 and 2
#Consider only those species that are present in both crown layers.
highSpp2 <- layerSpp[2,] / (layerSpp[2,] + layerSpp[1,])
highSpp2

#answer: species 2 has the highest relative portion of crown layer2 in layers 1 and 2 
#crown layers, considering those that have both layers present.


#Exercise 4
#Create the following subsets from file puudata_300.txt:
#a) Trees that are measured from plot (KOEALA) 865
treesA <- subset(data300, data300$KOEALA==865)
treesA

#b) Trees that are measured from plots 865 and 490
treesB<- subset(data300, data300$KOEALA==865 | data300$KOEALA==490)

#c) Those spruce trees (PUULAJI=2) that belong to second crown layer 
#and are over 10 meters tall (the height is given in decimeters).

#d) Those trees in the first crown layer, whose diameter is over 150 mm and 
#that are not pines or spruces (species 1 and 2)
